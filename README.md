## Task

The application contains `2 activities`. **The 1st** opens the second and sends a greeting `text` to it. **The 2nd** opens, receives the greeting text, the user enters a `name` in the text field and closes the activity. In this case, _the name is sent back to the first activity_ and it displays the greeting `text + name`.
